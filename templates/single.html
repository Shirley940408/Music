 		 <p>This is a totally random paragraph that doesnt actually mean anything, and is really talking about the random paragraph, there isnt much to worry sbout because its just a random paragraph, don’t worry, everything will be ok when random paragraph is by your side! Random paragraph is a completely random typed text, hense the name ‘random paragraph’. The way to shortcut into this paragraph is simply by typing ‘ran-para’, but without the hypen, as taking that out would cause an infinite loop of this same paragraph over and over. Random paragraph can also help in random situation, you know, it may be needy from time-to-time, but nevertheless, I recommend you always use it in random situations, and the funny thing is, random paragraph just explained what it is, in itself, so its confusing, but you’ll get it. If you want to use it for a shortcut in your iPhone, go to General > Keyboard > Text Replacement and then, copy in this whole paragraph as a phrase, and make the shortcut ‘ran-para’ without a hyphen! ...or whatever you want the shortcut text to be. Thanks for using random paragraph!</p>
